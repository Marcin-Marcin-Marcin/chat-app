React Native / Expo, Firebase: Auth (Anonymous), Firestore, Storage, react-native-gifted-chat, expo-image-picker, expo-location, react-native-maps, @react-native-async-storage/async-storage, @react-native-community/netinfo, @expo/react-native-action-sheet

Prerequisites

Node.js, Git, Expo Go app on Android/iOS device, Android Studio optional if using a physical device

Getting Started

1. Clone & Install
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd chat-app
   npm install

2. Firebase Setup
   Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com and configure the following:
   Enable Authentication - Sign-in method - Anonymous

Enable Firestore

Enable Storage

use rules:

service firebase.storage {
match /b/{bucket}/o {
match /{allPaths=\*\*} {
allow read, write: if true;
}
}
}

Copy your Firebase web config and paste it into App.js:

const firebaseConfig = {
apiKey: "...",
authDomain: "...",
projectId: "...",
storageBucket: "...",
messagingSenderId: "...",
appId: "..."
};

This app uses anonymous auth, Firestore for messages, and Storage for media.
